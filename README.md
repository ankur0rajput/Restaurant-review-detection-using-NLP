Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence that is focused on enabling computers to understand and process human languages, to get computers closer to a human-level understanding of language. 

Some of the important use of NLP algorithms are:

We can use NLP on a text review to predict if the review is good or bad. 
we can use NLP on an article to predict some categories of the articles you are trying to segment.
We can use NLP on a book to predict the genre of the book. And it can go further, you can use NLP to build a machine translator or a speech recognition system.

A very well-known model in NLP is the Bag of Words model. It is a model used to preprocess the texts to classify before fitting the classification algorithms on the observations containing the texts.
